-- 1.If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
SELECT 
SUM(CASE WHEN pizza_id = 1 THEN 12 
ELSE 10
END) AS total_revenue
FROM customer_orders c
JOIN runner_orders r
ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.distance IS NOT NULL AND r.distance <> 'null';
