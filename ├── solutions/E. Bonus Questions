-- If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?

Using the same schema existed in the database the answer will be:
INSERT INTO pizza_names
  ("pizza_id", "pizza_name")
VALUES
  (3, 'Supreme');
  
INSERT INTO pizza_recipes
  ("pizza_id", "toppings")
VALUES
  (3, '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12');

But, if Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas this requires enhancing the data design. So, I will create a new table for the pizza recipes and ALTER the toppings to be an INT.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pizza_recipes;
CREATE TABLE pizza_recipes (
  "pizza_id" INT,
  "toppings" INT;

INSERT INTO pizza_recipes
  ("pizza_id", "toppings")
VALUES
  (3, 1),
  (3, 2),
  (3, 3),
  (3, 4),
  (3, 5),
  (3, 6),
  (3, 7),
  (3, 8),
  (3, 9),
  (3, 10),
  (3, 11),
  (3, 12);
